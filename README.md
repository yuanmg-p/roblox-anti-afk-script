## 📌 Overview
This **AutoHotkey** script prevents Roblox from kicking you out after **20 minutes of inactivity**.  

Unlike basic AFK scripts, this one gives you **freedom to use your PC** without interruptions. It automatically opens Roblox, presses a key, and minimizes it back in a **blink of an eye**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Non-intrusive** — keeps Roblox active while you continue working or browsing.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight** — runs quietly in the background.  
- 🎛️ **Customizable** — easily change the timing and hotkey.  
- 🖥️ **PC only** — designed for Windows users with AutoHotkey.

## 🛠️ How to Use

2. Download this repository.  
3. Run the `.ahk` script file.  
4. Keep it running in the background while Roblox is open.

## ⚙️ Customization
- Change the **key** → set your own preferred key instead of the default `9`.
